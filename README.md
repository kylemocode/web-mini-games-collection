#### Rules

- Clicking a mine ends the game.
- Clicking a square with an adjacent mine clears that square and shows the number of mines touching it.
- Clicking a square with no adjacent mine clears that square and clicks all adjacent squares.
- The first click will never be a mine, it will clear the map and place numbers on the grid.
- The numbers reflect the number of mines touching a square.
- Right clicking on a square puts a flag on it. The flagged square canâ€™t be opened by a click.
- If the number in a square is equal to the number of squares touching that square that are flagged, double clicking on the number opens up all remaining squares around the number.

#### Future Roadmap

- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Support Mobile Devices (Touch Events)
- [ ] Addressing the issue where certain emojis may not display correctly on different operating systems.
